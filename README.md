A sample T9 Emulator made in java with a modified Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure.

Works via terminal input.

Each node of the trie has a list of words associated with the node traversal.
This trie is implemented without any leaf identifiers.

TO DO:
Non-static filepath
Weightage algorithm for suggestions
Dynamic input checking (?)
