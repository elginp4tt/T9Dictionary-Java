<h1>T9 Emulator written in Java</h1>

<h2>A sample T9 Emulator made in java with a modified Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure.</h2>

Works via terminal input.

Each node of the trie has a list of words associated with the node traversal.
This trie is implemented without any leaf identifiers.

TO DO:
- Non-static filepath
- Weightage algorithm for suggestions
- Dynamic input checking (?)
